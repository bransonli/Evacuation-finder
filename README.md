# About NEAT's Evacuation Finder 

Neat's Evacuation Finder is a web application that aims to guide its users to the nearest evacuation center near them through the input of certain information upon signing up. We believe that by allowing users to accessibly learn of the nearest evacuation center near them, they can be prepared and guided to safety in times of calamity. Evacuation Finder provides accessibility and ease to this process by automatically pinpointing the closest evacuation center to the user by through the input of a username, address, and phone number. In the case of no internet connectivity during a time of calamity, Evacuation FInder will also be sending a SMS to the user's specified phone number.  

Evacuation Finder is accessible, easy to use, and reliable--providing the users with the necessary information to lead them to a safe place.
